# Obsidian Cursor Position History Plugin

**Effortlessly navigate your notes with enhanced cursor memory and history tracking.**

This free & open-source plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) provides two powerful functionalities to improve your workflow when working with large vaults, containing multiple notes, in Obsidian:

## Features

1. **Remember Cursor Position in Files**
	- The plugin remembers the exact cursor position in the previous file when you navigate to another file.
	- When you return to the same file, it automatically scrolls back to the position where you left off, saving you time and effort.

2. **Cursor History Navigation**
	- The plugin keeps a history of your cursor positions across files.
	- Use customizable shortcuts to:
		- **Go Back**: Jump to the previous cursor position in the history.
		- **Go Forward**: Return to the next cursor position in the history.
	- This feature is perfect for quickly navigating between different parts of your notes without losing context.

## Why Use This Plugin?
With this plugin, you'll never lose your place again when switching between notes, and you'll have complete control over your navigation history.

- Stay focused and avoid losing track of where you were working.
- Quickly navigate between related sections of your notes or across different files.
- Ideal for researchers, writers, or anyone who frequently switches between notes.

## Shortcuts

- `Return to Previous Cursor Position`: go back
- `Re-return to Next Cursor Position`: go forward
